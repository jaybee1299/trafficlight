# Arduino with voice recognition
Dataset

This project uses two models trained using Teachable Machine:

voice Recognition Model â€“ (python) Identifies specific commands by the user.
Arduino model- Helps with integrating Python to control or interact with an Arduino board through VS Code.

Project Step
for Arduino, build your hardware content using the Arduino box that can be programmed with the Arduino software.
Make sure your code runs seamlessly and the serial port is well connected and functional.

for voice recognition, using Python through vsCODE. find the best ai tool i.e (whisper ai).
download the best python version that works with your ai model. 

Open the Arduino IDE and upload the basic code that listens for commands from Python to control the LED light.
The code should: -Turn on the green LED when you say friday, 
red LED when you say Saturday, white LED when you say sunday.
turn ON all LED when you say weekend, 
turn OFF all LED when you say OFF or Turn OFF.

Version Used
VSCODE python 3.12
latest Arduino IDE 2.3.4 
Hardware: Arduino Mega 2560
